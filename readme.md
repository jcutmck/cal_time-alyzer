# JSON to CSV Converter

This is a simple web app prototype that converts user-uploaded JSON file into a CSV format. I intended this to be a method of tranforming calendar data and plan to play with adding analytics on the backend to output interesting details about calendar information entered, like how long spent in meetings. It features a React frontend and a Python backend.

## Features

- Upload a `.json` file up to 500KB.

- Convert the file to a downloadable `.csv` file.

- Simple, clean user interface.
